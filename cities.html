<h3>monocentricity</h3>
<br/>

in the morning<br/>
trams ding and shuffle<br/>
decades old<br/>
into the centre<br/>
<br/>
cyclists begin<br/>
that fierce commute<br/>
through danger<br/>
and cold<br/>
<br/>
the gaps close<br/>
as the flood thickens<br/>
over the tolls and old roads<br/>
the “shortcuts”<br/>
and the freeways<br/>
<br/>
the trains are late again<br/>
but when they come<br/>
we cram together<br/>
to breathe the same air<br/>
<br/>
and the same rain falls on us<br/>
as we dare our bodies<br/>
to cross at a green light<br/>
<br/>
we open our eyes<br/>
briefly<br/>
as we plunge into rhythm <br/>
to a city<br/>
