<h3>writer's plea</h3>
<br/>

tell me<br/>
that what my eyes see<br/>
is worth seeing<br/>
<br/>
that what my body feels<br/>
my mind thinks<br/>
is worth feeling<br/>
is worth thinking<br/>
<br/>
tell me<br/>
that the pen in my hand<br/>
my self at the desk<br/>
is there for beauty's sake<br/>
for the truth of art<br/>
<br/>
tell me<br/>
that in these notebooks<br/>
<em>all these notebooks</em><br/>
there is something that will live<br/>
for longer than me<br/>
